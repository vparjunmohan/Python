'''Write a Python program to calculate the maximum profit from selling and buying values of stock. An array of numbers represent the stock prices in chronological order. 
For example, given [8, 10, 7, 5, 7, 15], the function will return 10, since the buying value of the stock is 5 dollars and sell value is 15 dollars.'''
