'''Write a Python program that accept an even number (>=4, Goldbach number) from the user and create a combinations that express the given number as a sum of two prime numbers. Print the number of combinations.
Goldbach number: A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.[4] Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.
The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
6 = 3 + 3
8 = 3 + 5
10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
12 = 7 + 5
...
100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53
Input an even number (0 to exit):
100
Number of combinations:
6'''
