'''Write a Python program to check whether two given lines are parallel or not. 
Note: Parallel lines are two or more lines that never intersect. Parallel Lines are like railroad tracks that never intersect.
The General Form of the equation of a straight line is: ax + by = c
The said straight line is represented in a list as [a, b, c]
Example of two parallel lines:
x + 4y = 10 and x + 4y = 14'''


def parallel_lines(line1, line2):
    return line1[0]/line1[1] == line2[0]/line2[1]


# 2x + 3y = 4, 2x + 3y = 8
print(parallel_lines([2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 8]))
# 2x + 3y = 4, 4x - 3y = 8
print(parallel_lines([2, 3, 4], [4, -3, 8]))
