''' Write a Python program to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of numbers a1, a2, a3, ... an. A subsequence of one element is also a continuous subsequence.
Input:
You can assume that 1 = n = 5000 and -100000 = ai = 100000.
Input numbers are separated by a space.
Input 0 to exit.
Input number of sequence of numbers you want to input (0 to exit):
3
Input numbers:
2
4
6
Maximum sum of the said contiguous subsequence:
12 Input number of sequence of numbers you want to input (0 to exit):
0'''

while True:
    print('Input number of sequence of numbers you want to input (0 to exit):')
    n = int(input())
    if n == 0:
        break
    else:
        A = []
        Sum = []
        print("Input numbers:")
        for i in range(n):
            A.append(int(input()))
        Wa = 0
        for i in range(0, n):
            Wa += A[i]
            Sum.append(Wa)

                Sum.append(Num)
