'''When character are consecutive in a string , it is possible to shorten the character string by replacing the character with a certain rule. For example, in the case of the character string YYYYY, if it is expressed as # 5 Y, it is compressed by one character.
Write a Python program to restore the original string by entering the compressed string with this rule. However, the # character does not appear in the restored character string. 
Note: The original sentences are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, less than 100 letters, and consecutive letters are not more than 9 letters.
Input:
The restored character string for each character on one line.
Original text: XY#6Z1#4023
XYZZZZZZ1000023
Original text: #39+1=1#30
999+1=1000'''
