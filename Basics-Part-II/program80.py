'''Write a Python program to randomly generate a list with 10 even numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive. 
Note: Use random.sample() to generate a list of random values.
Sample Output:
[4, 22, 8, 20, 24, 12, 30, 98, 28, 48]'''

import random

print(random.sample([i for i in range(1, 100) if i % 2 == 0], 10))
