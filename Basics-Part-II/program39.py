'''Write a Python program to check whether a point (x,y) is in a triangle or not. There is a triangle formed by three points. 
Input:
x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,xp,yp separated by a single space.
Input three coordinate of the circle:
9 3 6 8 3 6
Radius of the said circle:
3.358
Central coordinate (x, y) of the circle:
6.071 4.643'''

print('Input x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,xp,yp:')
x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, xp, yp = map(float, input().split())
c1 = (x2-x1)*(yp-y1)-(y2-y1)*(xp-x1)
c2 = (x3-x2)*(yp-y2)-(y3-y2)*(xp-x2)
c3 = (x1-x3)*(yp-y3)-(y1-y3)*(xp-x3)
if (c1 < 0 and c2 < 0 and c3 < 0) or (c1 > 0 and c2 > 0 and c3 > 0):
    print('The point is in the triangle.')
else:
    print('The point is outside the triangle.')
