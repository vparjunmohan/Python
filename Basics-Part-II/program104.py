'''Write a Python program to check whether a given sequence is linear, quadratic or cubic.

Sequences are sets of numbers that are connected in some way.
Linear sequence:
A number pattern which increases or decreases by the same amount each time is called a linear sequence. The amount it increases or decreases by is known as the common difference.
Quadratic sequence:
In quadratic sequence, the difference between each term increases, or decreases, at a constant rate.
Cubic sequence:
Sequences where the 3rd difference are known as cubic sequence.'''
