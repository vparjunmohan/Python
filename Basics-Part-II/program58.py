'''A convex polygon is a simple polygon in which no line segment between two points on the boundary ever goes outside the polygon. Equivalently, it is a simple polygon whose interior is a convex set. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than or equal to 180 degrees, while in a strictly convex polygon all interior angles are strictly less than 180 degrees.
Write a Python program that compute the area of the polygon . The vertices have the names vertex 1, vertex 2, vertex 3, ... vertex n according to the order of edge connections 
Note: The original sentences are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, less than 100 letters, and consecutive letters are not more than 9 letters.'''
